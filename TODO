* Rooms
  * these should be like lego blocks: easy to assemble and create structures
  * rooms should be able to emit sounds and other environmental data (writing
    to the server instance)
  * rooms should have randomly discoverable items in them
  * rooms should have the ability to be composed of "areas"
    * players can enter these areas
    * the area should support micro environments
